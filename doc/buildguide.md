## Part List
These parts are needed to create a complete keyboard. The "where to get it" column are just suggestions. There are many places to source most all of these parts.

| Count | Part | Description | Where to get it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1  | PCB | The printed circuit board onto which will be mounted all of the components. | Here (pcb_stamp/production/gerber.zip) in this repository are the files necessary to have the board fabricated. I usec JLCPCB, and got excellent results for a good price. |
| 4 | Top Plate (1mm thickness) | The non-electrical plates that mechanically serve to hold the Choc switches in place. Two are required on each side. | Get these fabricated too. (top_plate/production/gerber.zip) |
| 1 | Bottom Plate | The non-electrical plate that serves as the base of the keyboard | Get these fabricated too. (bottom_plate/production/gerber.zip) |
