# richkbd 1.0.0
 
The richkbd keyboard is based on two split [Corne keyboards](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) joined together into one, and powered by the [RP2040](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2040/) by using the [Stamp](https://www.solder.party/docs/rp2040-stamp) helper board. It also has an OLED display, and a neopixel per key.
